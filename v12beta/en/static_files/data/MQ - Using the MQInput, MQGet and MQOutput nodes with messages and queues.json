MQOutput nodes send separate messages with the name of one person to one queue and the name of the other person to a second queue. Both MQ messages are given the same MsgId in their MQMD header. A second message flow is driven by an MQInput node reading one of these messages from its queue. Next an MQGet node uses the MsgId to read in the second message.
