The HTTPInput node also drives an HTTP Header node which deletes the HTTP input header, before invoking a Mapping node whose role is to set a message topic in the logical tree. Finally, a Publication node publishes to the defined MQ topic. A second message flow is provided which receives messages from three separate input queues, each of which receive messages courtesy of MQ subscriptions to the same topic used by the publication flow."
