The application uses the ACEv11 Java Integration API's com.ibm.integration.admin.http.* classes. These classes are strategic for the ACEv11 product. Users may find them more generalized than the classes provided in the package com.ibm.integration.admin.proxy The proxy package provides proxy objects for each item in the ACE runtime hierarchy i.e. integration server proxy, application proxy, message flow proxy etc. The http package is structured to expect from the developer a URL (matching the ACE administrative REST API) to describe a particular resource in the ACE runtime hierarchy. Which of these approaches you prefer may vary from developer to developer. For existing IBM Integration Bus users, the proxy package approach may be most familiar. To entirely new users the http package approach may be most easily understood. It is also possible to use classes from both packages within the same program, because the com.ibm.integration.admin.model.* classes can be used to help developers parse responses to requests in both styles. Whilst this tutorial focuses on the com.ibm.integration.admin.http package, another tutorial is provided which concentrates on com.ibm.integration.admin.proxy."
