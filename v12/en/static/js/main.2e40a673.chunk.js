The purpose of optimization is to speed up server startup in cloud container environments. The techniques discussed here only apply to independent integration servers and are not suitable for integration servers that are managed by an integration node. Server optimization is suitable when the server content is fixed and it is desireable to reduce the startup time of the process to be as short as possible based upon the server\'s current settings and content. The tutorial provides a simple example message flow which will be deployed and tested using a local independent integration server, initially created in the Toolkit. The tutorial then switches to a Command Console where the ibmint command will be used to demonstrate the process of optimizing startup. The tutorial deliberately breaks down the optimization task into two separate stages, in order to better identify and explain some of the most frequently used options. The first optimization stage demonstrates how the server itself can decide which components are unnecessary (based upon the server\'s configuration and deployed content). The second optimization stage goes a step further and demonstrates the impact of switching off the server\'s use of NodeJS, which causes a further speeding of startup, at the cost of switching off administrative API (and therefore Web UI) access to the server."}]},"helpLinks":{"_helpLinksComment":"Helplinks that have a type:web attribute are rendered as web links.

There are three message flows - a RequestFlow, a BackendApplicationFlow and a ReplyFlow. RequestFlow receives JSON data over HTTP, and stores the initial input data on a queue, before passing part of the data on to the BackendApplicationFlow using an MQ queue. The MQ message is written using the HTTP Reply Identifier as the MsgId value. When the BackendReplyApp responds, it follows the very common MQ Request-Reply convention of copying this identifier into the CorrelId of the MQ reply message. This means that the final ReplyFlow can recover the stored initial input data and unify part of this data with the repsonse from the backend and return it to the initial requesting HTTP client."},{"section":"To simulate how a similar pattern might apply to real world scenarios, RequestFlow and ReplyFlow also execute simple message transformation from JSON to XML and vice versa.

The main choice to make when executing Integration Server JUnits in the Tookit is whether you would like to use a temporary working directory to support the integration server, or an existing working directory which you have previously configured. It is expected that the majority of unit testing will be for individual message flow nodes, and will not require any further specialised settings for the configuration of the integration server, so it is expected that most users will typically use the default selection of <b>Use temporary working directory</b>. There may be circumstances where you wish to execute tests which rely on a server using particular port numbers, or to have access to other configuration resources such as particular policy documents or credentials for third party systems. This configuration can be set up in advance of running the test, and by pointing the server to an existing working directory, these additional configurations will be available to the server which is being used to execute the tests when it starts. Choosing this configuration approach brings its own additional complexities. For example you should make sure that there are no other active integration servers on your machine using the nominated working directory. You may also need to be concerned with potential port conflicts. If you select <b>Use an existing working directory</b> then you will also have the opportunity to select the option named <b>Clear the deployed resources in the existing working directory before the Test Run</b>. This is not selected by default, because typically if you have chosen to use an existing working directory, you are most likely to want to preserve what\'s already deployed (these files are stored in the run subdirectory of the working directory). You can experiment with the settings we have discussed, but for the instructions below in this tutorial we will assume the default choice to <b>Use temporary working directory</b>."},{"details":"Staying on the Integration Server Settings tab, at the bottom of the window you will find some further settings:<br><b>Start Flow threads</b> This checkbox is not selected by default. For most unit test at a granularity of a specific message flow node, you will not need to start message flow threads, but when doing whole flow testing there may be circumstances where you will need this option. Do not select it for the purpose of this tutorial.<br><b>Disable the REST API administration Port</b> This checkbox is selected by default. Typically you will not need to communicate with an integration server whilst it executes your unit tests so normally you will be advised to leave this checkbox selected. For the sake of this tutorial demonstration, untick the box.<br><b>Real/Fake MQ Manager Name for unit testing: FakeQueueManagerName</b> Some unit tests may involve message flows which contain message flow nodes such as the MQInput or MQOutput node whose purpose is to interact with MQ. It is likely that these kind of unit test won\'t actually need messages to be written to an actual queue, but to avoid configuration errors being encountered by the server when it starts it may be helpful to leave this property with its default value of FakeQueueManagerName. You can of course specify a Queue Manager name of your own choice if you prefer.<br><b>Trace options</b> provides a dropdown with three possible integration server tracing options - none, service and diagnostic. These options will only be needed when requested by an IBM Support representative. Tracing should only be used in rare circumstances when requested by IBM as it will significantly slow down the server.

The command is used to extract configuration and resources on the same computer or a different computer. You can choose to extract components from an integration node or from an integration server. Extracting the configuration and resources from an integration node also extracts the configuration and resources of all the integration servers that are associated with the integration node. In either case, you will run the mqsibackupbroker command on the source system and then transfer the backup file that is created to the computer to which you are extracting the configuration and resources.

You can configure integration servers to be associated with an integration node that looks after them, or to run independently of an integration node. If you are planning to run App Connect Enterprise directly on a physical machine or virtual machine image, then you are advised to define integration servers under an integration node to manage the associated integration servers. If you are planning to run the App Connect Enterprise in conjunction with a container framework such as Kubernetes, then it is the responsibility of this framework to ensure that the servers remain running (or are restarted appropriately) so in this situation using independent integration servers would be the better choice."}]}},"pageSteps":{"create":{"overview":{"name":"Create","heading":"Import project","_createComment":"A description of what will happen when the user clicks Import.","sections":[{"section":"Click <span class=\'uicontrol\'>Import</span> and a single project named <b>MigrationTutorialHelperFiles</b> will be imported into your workspace.
